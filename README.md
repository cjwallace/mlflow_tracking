# MLFlow for experiment tracking

[MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/) self describes as an open-source platform for the machine learning lifecycle.
Perhaps its most useful feature is experiment tracking.
This feature works exceptionally well with Cloudera Machine Learning, and this repository demonstrates basic usage.

*TODO:* Documentation.
